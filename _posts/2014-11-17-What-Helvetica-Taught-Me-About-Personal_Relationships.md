Oh, the almighty Helvetica.
===

Designed by Max Miedinger (props to you too, Eduard Hoffman *power fist emoji*), Helvetica is the praised typeface of modern graphic design. It was modeled loosely after our …err, okay, my beloved Akzidenz-Grotesk, among other things. Designed to be neutral, incredibly clear and void of any natural applied meaning it was the face of choice for things like signage and many corporate logos. If we ran down the list of all the times it has been used, we would be here forever.

But that is not what we are here to discuss.

In my work life I began to see a growing dependency on Helvetica. It was trustworthy. It was always there when I needed. At the very least, it would get me through the day. **That’s why I had to let it go.** It was not Helvetica’s fault. Good old Helv was not hiding its utility and, in fact, it was laying everything out on the table. “This is who I am, these are my characteristics, and this is what my creator meant for me to be.” I knew what it was there for. I knew its history. But, I was trying to use it for things that it never offered me. I was searching for Helvetica to get me out of prolonging my journey on the job and provide an “out” on any given day. I could not bear the thought of research. That is to say that I could not see myself spending time looking for something more appropriate for that moment.

It made me lazy.

Lazy in the sense that I knew better. In all actuality, I knew that I knew better. Helvetica was not going to take me to the next level, but it was most definitely going to satisfy the current criteria and guarantee comfort. Once I made myself realize what I was doing, it was like turning a corner in a labyrinth that I had been trapped in for months and seeing the exit. Everything became clear. I needed to take the long way. I needed to study.

**I could no longer mold Helvetica. I would no longer mold Helvetica…**

**…because it never asked me to.**
